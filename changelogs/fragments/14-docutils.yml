minor_changes:
  - "Add functionality to parse documents, and to search for code blocks in parsed documents.
     This allows to perform other operations on the parsed document, instead of having to parse
     it multiple times
     (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docutils/pull/14,
     https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docutils/pull/16)."
