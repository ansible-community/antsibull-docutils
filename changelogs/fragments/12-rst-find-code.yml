minor_changes:
  - "Add helper ``antsibull_docutils.rst_code_finder.find_code_blocks()`` that allows to find code blocks in RST files.
     This is useful for linters and also code that wants to modify the code block's contents.
     (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-docutils/pull/12)."
